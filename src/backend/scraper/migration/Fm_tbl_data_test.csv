This is our passion and our life, not just a hobby. We offer regular group classes, private small group training, and private one-on-one training.  How we’re different You won’t find rows and rows of single-purpose machines at CrossFit Fresno. Traditional hard work and sweat, not cables and motors move the weights in our facility. There are no televisions or mirrors. Because working hard alongside your fellow members and cheering each other on is where the real entertainment is. What you will find in our facility are barbells, medicine balls, kettlebells, pull-up bars, and most importantly, wide open space for all the fun.  What we do We don’t train for the sake of vanity and we don’t do body building split-routines that focus on isolation. We train movements that you see in life because we want to improve your quality of life. Greater mental fortitude, feeling good, and looking awesome are just lucky side effects of your hard work.  It is important to us to record how every member does in every workout. Because to truly see the success of our program, our members’ performances must by measurable and repeatable. It is this measurement of performance that promotes healthy competition, intensity, determination, and a commitment from our members that drive them to excel and achieve results that were never thought possible. With that said it must be noted that results are not guaranteed, they are earned!  Who we serve Regardless of current fitness level, we can make this program work for anyone willing to put in the effort. There’s no need to feel intimidated if you don’t know anything about CrossFit. And don’t be misguided into thinking that you need to get fit before coming in to see us; it’s our duty to get you fit! Whether you’ve been working out regularly for years or it’s been years since you’ve worked out, we are here to facilitate your decision to improve your performance and your health now.  Our promise to you We promise to provide a safe, supportive, and professional environment where you feel motivated and inspired to exceed your previous limits and pursue excellence in fitness and in life.",True,http://www.crossfitfresno.com/images/games2012_banner.jpg,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-tmr17yTVlE,http://www.crossfitfresno.com/images/coach_jon.jpg,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=xShmoddPPbQ,http://www.crossfitfresno.com/images/rosanna_pushpress.jpg,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Czm1eJeBHHI,http://www.crossfitfresno.com/images/try_us_button_barbell.jpg,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ifUfB1PEZ3w,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GqrsY9ZrydE,90 E.
